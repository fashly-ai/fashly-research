Note:
To utilize ComfyUI workflow, you must check the specific licenses of the models and custom nodes you use, as some are restricted to non-commercial use. ComfyUI itself is a tool, and its commercial viability depends on the licenses of its components, not the software itself. For example, some core components like IPAdapter require attribution, while other models may have licenses that explicitly permit commercial use. For example, base model flux schnell f8 is non-commercial purpose.
